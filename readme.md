## Search Method Comparisons
### Practicing writing functions and the concepts of encapsulation,  algorithmic thinking, and logarithmic complexity.</br></br>

Running search_compare will:

    1. Take user input to generate a random list of integers or strings 
    2. Run and time each type of search automatically


As of first commit,  it will run a binary search and a linear search. 

Note: This initial binary search was created without using recursion, leaving room for future optimization.
